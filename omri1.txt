With eyes filled with tears, I looked at the strange figure that appeared before me. Please don't forget that at that very hour I was in the heart of a desert, at a distance of a thousand miles from any place of return. And despite all this, the little barnacle was not seen as lost in finding a way, nor as fainting from exhaustion or hunger, thirst or fear. His sight was nothing like the sight of a child lost in the heart of the wilderness, at a distance of a thousand miles from any settlement.

When my hand finally came up to take a sentence out of my mouth I asked in bewilderment:

- What are you doing in this place?

However, he calmly returned his request as he was talking about a very respectable matter:

- Come on... draw me a sheep!..

When we stand before a great mystery, we dare not show reluctance. With all the irony in the matter - that after all, I had been wearing it for an hour at a distance of a thousand miles from any place that would return and expected the danger of death - I took out of my pocket a piece of paper and t originates. However, I remembered that most of my time was devoted mainly to studying geography, the words of the sea, calculation and accuracy; That's why I told the guy (with a bit of irritation) that I don't know how to draw. So he answered and said:

- It's alright. Draw me a sheep!

I have never drawn sheep, so I returned to one of the two drawings that I had in my hand, it is the drawing of the snake escaping from the inside. To the rabbi's curiosity, the boy said:

- no and no! I don't want an elephant inside a rattlesnake. The escaping snake is a dangerous creature and the elephant is heavy and burdensome. And for them everything is very small. I need a sheep, draw me a sheep!

I created.
